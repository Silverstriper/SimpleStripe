# SimpleStripe Theme Details
SimpleStripe is a basic bare bones theme for Silverstripe. It utilizes html5 for the code markup.  SimpleStripe is simple and semantic and build under the philosophy of Progressive Enhancement and Progressive Enrichment. SimpleStripe's inspiration is drawn directly from SimpleFolio - a wordpress theme. SimpleStripe borrows heavily from this theme's look and feel but departs from that inspiration to enable this for SilverStripe as well as make it html5 compliant.

SimpleStripe was built for Silverstripe 2.4 and greater.

## To Install
* Put the contents of the simplestripe folder into your /themes directory in your silverstripe project. Make sure the folder is named "simplestripe"
* In your config file in: ./mysite/_config.php, you will need to change the setting for theme. Add or edit the following line of code:SSViewer::set_theme('themename'); 
[Alternate: in Silverstripe 2.4 > you can just choose the theme in Site Settings in admin]
* Once you've added the code, visit your homepage, and flush the cache (append ?flush=1 to the url). Your new theme should now be working.
